## Labs for Intro to Grad Stats for Sociologists

This is a set of labs designed for use by grad students in their first statistics class. The purpose of the labs is to introduce students both to the R programming language and to introductory statistics for social science research. The labs were developed based on Kyle Crowder's materials used at the University of Washington, and are currently in use by me, Ian Kennedy, at the Univeristy of Illinois at Chicago.
